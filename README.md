# StudyHours

v0.9: still need to adjust charts a bit

I just wanted a small tool to help keep me productive and track the numbers of hours I'm studying/being productive.
Since everything out there is mostly too complex for my usecase, I decided hey, why not do it myself?

So here is Studyhours:
1. You just open the studyhours.py file to start tracking time
2. You press the Stop button to stop tracking
3. the csv file at ./data/studyhours.csv gets updated

You also get a few simple charts to visualize your history on the click of a button!

Charts:

Please feel free to download & use/modify however you want.
If you have any suggestions in regards to code/features, I'm open to advice :)
